The information and the CTA button in the hero section make it unambiguously clear to them that they can register for a seminar on soil health. If they choose to scroll through the page and familiarize themselves with the seminar topics, they are presented with a second CTA button at the bottom of the page as well as clear information on when and where the seminar takes place and how much it costs.

The social media links in the footer allow the visitor to check out the organisers' reputation in social networks. 

#### Returning visitors

Returning visitors who already know that they want register for the seminar can use the CTA button in the hero section of the landing page to quickly get to the registration form. There, they also find the date and place of the next seminar as well as the amount of available places.

### Known bugs

- When scrolling through the landing page on a mobile, one can sometimes see the background images of the scroll-by sections jump or slightly change their size. So far, I was unable to fix this issue. 
- On the Why and About pages, in mobile view, paragraphs that are inside a div element with a class of `.reverse-order` have smaller left and right margins than the other paragraphs on those pages. I have yet to find the reason for that.
