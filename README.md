# Soil is Life project website

This project is an intuitive multi-page website informing visitors about a seminar on soil health that is held in TÃ¶reboda, Sweden. The main purpose of the site is to allow visitors to fill out a form and register for the upcoming seminar. The secondary purpose of the site is to inform visitors about the seminar organisers and to provide more information on the seminar topic, soil.

The website is fully responsive across multiple devices.

### Known bugs

- When scrolling through the landing page on a mobile, one can sometimes see the background images of the scroll-by sections jump or slightly change their size. So far, I was unable to fix this issue. 
- On the Why and About pages, in mobile view, paragraphs that are inside a div element with a class of `.reverse-order` have smaller left and right margins than the other paragraphs on those pages. I have yet to find the reason for that.
